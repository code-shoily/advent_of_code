# AdventOfCode

Advent of Code puzzle solutions in Elixir. It's work in progress and starting year 2015 to 2019, random days are attempted.

All solution modules reside in `lib/<year>/day_<day>.ex` and associated tests have the same structure in `test/` folder. Input files are in `lib/data/inputs/<year>_<day>.txt`.

To make the experience boilerplate free and give all solutions uniform (more or less) structure, type `mix solve --year <year> --day <day>` to have the structure and stub generated. Type `mix help solve` for more.

run `mix test` to ensure all solutions are working okay.
